The Mapnik team is pleased to announce Mapnik 2.0.1, the first stable bugfix release on top of 2.0.0. The notable thing about this release is that it fully supports PostGIS 2.0.

For details on other fixes see the Changelog on the [wiki](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/Release2.0.1) or via the 2.1.0 entry in the [master CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Get the source from the [downloads page](http://mapnik.org/download/).

Note for TileMill users: TileMill currently requires >= 2.1.x, so current master Mapnik and will not work with 2.0.1. So, if you are looking for a release for TileMill stay tuned and watch for 2.1 to be released once we can narrow down the [2.1 issue queue](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues?milestone=8&state=open).
