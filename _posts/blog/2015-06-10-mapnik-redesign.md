Mapnik.org has a new look. Not just a fresh coat, the goals for the redesign include:

 - Get started with Mapnik faster.
 - Better documentation for Mapnik code, bindings, and styling.
 - More accessible news regarding Mapnik.


Quickly copy code snippets to run and render maps using Node.js, Python, or C++. Pair with a stylesheet for custom styling. Detailed API docs are available.

[The latest news post]({{site.baseurl}}#latest-news) or [the entire news archive]({{site.baseurl}}/news/archive.html) are now only a click away.

## Logo

Mapnik has a new logo!

Inspired by the previous logo, the "mapnik" mark is now typeset in [open-source](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) Google Font [Maven Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Maven+Pro), selected particularly for it's double story a, dramatic k, and the square [tittle](http://blog.dictionary.com/tittle/) over the i. Maven Pro is a modern san-serif font with unique curves and a nice, pronounced rhythm.



## Colors

Taking note from previous colors, we've pick a more vibrant, yet earthy palatte. Featuring a lighter sky blue that balances well with earth-tones and the warmth of traditional topographic map of natural and man-made features.
