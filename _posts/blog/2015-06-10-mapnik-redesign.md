Mapnik.org has a new look and easier access to updates, code, and documentation. Quickly copy code snippets to run and render maps using Node.js, Python, or C++, pair with a stylesheet for custom styling, and link to detailed API docs. 

And [latest news posts]({{site.baseurl}}#latest-news) and [entire news archive]({{site.baseurl}}/news/archive.html) are now only a click away.

## Logo

Mapnik has a new logo!

Inspired by the previous logo, the "mapnik" mark is now typeset in [open-source](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) Google Font [Maven Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Maven+Pro), selected particularly for it's double story a, dramatic k, and the square [tittle](http://blog.dictionary.com/tittle/) over the i. Maven Pro is a modern san-serif font with unique curves and a nice, pronounced rhythm.


## Colors

Taking note from previous colors, we've pick a more vibrant, yet earthy palatte. Featuring a lighter sky blue that balances well with earth-tones and the warmth of traditional topographic map of natural and man-made features.
