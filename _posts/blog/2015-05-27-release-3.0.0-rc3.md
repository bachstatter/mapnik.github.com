We had so many people testing 3.0.0-rc2 that we were able to find a lot of issues quickly. In order to help people testing we have decided to push out a release candidate 3! Thank you so much everyone for your help! Not all the issues are resolved yet, but we are working hard to be done by early in June with the official 3.0.0 release.

You can [download rc3](http://s3.amazonaws.com/mapnik/dist/v3.0.0-rc3/mapnik-v3.0.0-rc3.tar.bz2) or checkout out the tag from our [github repository](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/tree/v3.0.0-rc3). 

You can still follow the progress of the release on [github](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/2811) as well.
