Put changelog summary here.

## Looking Forward

There is still plenty to work on in Mapnik and we are excited to work on fixing many different issues we know exist already. We want to keep expanding on our abilities to provide fast and beautiful maps.

We are planning on making our future releases at a quicker pace, and we are looking at ways to improve the distribution of our binary packages. We recognize that building from source is not ideal for many developers and we are looking for more ways to make our different language bindings easier to install and learn to use. 

Expect to see more documentation and more news here soon!
