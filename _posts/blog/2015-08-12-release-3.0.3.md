As promised in our last post, the next release of Mapnik was to follow shortly. This release focuses on having a well tested and functional SVG parser. While SVG functionality was present in earlier releases, this is a vast improvement in speed and efficiency over the previous parser. Additionally, as part of this release we have removed the dependence on libxml2 from the mapnik library.

Very pleased to announce 3.0.3 release! This release adds three new image-filters to simulate types of colour blindness - great work [Blake](https://github.com/flippmoke)! We restored support for legacy format for setting JPEG output quality - welcome back `jpeg85`. As always the main focus is on stability, performance and addesssing issues which we discovered while testing. Check out [v3.0.3 Changelog](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#303) for more details.
