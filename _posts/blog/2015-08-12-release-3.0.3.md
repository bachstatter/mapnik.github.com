Very pleased to announce 3.0.3 release! This release adds three new image-filters to simulate types of colour blindness - great work [Blake](https://github.com/flippmoke)! We restored support for legacy format for setting JPEG output quality - welcome back `jpeg85`. As always the main focus is on stability, performance and addesssing issues which we discovered while testing. Check out [v3.0.3 Changelog](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#303) for more details.
