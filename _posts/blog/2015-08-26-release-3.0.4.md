Latest Mapnik v3.0.4 (codenamed "Fyn") is here. It comes with a fully refreshed CSV plug-in and various bug fixes and improvements. `CSV.input` was optimised for a very light memory footprint at runtime. The refactored code will make it easier to add more features in the future. For example, supporting more ways to encode geometry in CSV (https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/2876).
