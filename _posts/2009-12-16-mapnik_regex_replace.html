<p>Regular expressions are very useful when working with text.We already had 'match' operator which can be used in filterexpressions. In <ahref="http://mapnik.org/news/2009/dec/08/future_mapnik2/">Mapnik2</a> wenow also have <pre>&lt;mapnik-expression&gt;.replace(&lt;regex&gt;,&lt;pattern&gt;)</pre>Here is a small example :<pre>>>> from mapnik import *>>> f = Feature(123)>>> f["name"] = 'Mapnik'>>> expr = Expression("[name].replace('(\\B)|( )','$1 ')")>>> expr.evaluate(f)'M a p n i k'</pre></p>
