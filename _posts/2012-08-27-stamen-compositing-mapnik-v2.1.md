What if there were software that combined the power of Photoshop image effects with Illustrator like vector transformations that was fully open source, spatially capable, and could handle big data like OpenStreetMap? Well, hopefully as you start using Mapnik 2.1 this future will feel near.

### Thanks Stamen

Our friends at [Stamen Design](http://stamen.com) have been advocating for the value of Photoshop-like alpha blending in mapping for many years. As far back as 2008 Mike was already beautifully [working around](http://mike.teczno.com/notes/hillshading.html) limitations in Mapnik for terrain hillshading and proactively advocating for better support by writing new software like [TileStache](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.mapnik.devel/518). Shaun was instrumental in helping me see the viability of compositing in Mapnik by helping sketching out ideas [on the Mapnik wiki](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/Ideas_Compositing).

### A compositing framework in Core

In time, Mapnik 0.7.x added support for blending modes in rasters thanks to the work of [Marcin Rudowski](http://mapa.ump.waw.pl/ump-www/). And as of last week, with the <a href="news/2012/08/24/release-2.1.0/">release of Mapnik 2.1</a>, we now support the `comp-op` property on all symbolizers (and Styles) to make possible compositing for both vectors and rasters. The support we have now is a solid framework to build on, and more modes can now easily be added with few code changes. Last week I saw [Shaun advocating](http://twitter.com/shawnbot/status/239186880762085377) for the full suite of advanced photoshop blend modes in the upcoming CSS Spec, which is awesome and something we can [also do in Mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1448).

### Revisting innovations

After reflecting on how far we've come in Mapnik and thinking of Shaun's work I was reminded of his sweet little project called [Trees, Cabs & Crime](http://content.stamen.com/trees-cabs-crime_in_venice) where he experimented with rendering three themes of point data and compositing them together using subtractive blending to bring out patterns of correlation.

Now that Mapnik 2.1 is out I figured it should be doable to render Shaun's exact map with just a single Mapnik stylesheet.

### Trees, Cabs & Crime re-rendered in Mapnik 2.1

After finding [Shaun's makefiles](https://github.com/shawnbot/concoct/blob/master/Makefile) I saw the process might be as simple as rendering data from three csv files and using a darkening blend mode as each canvas is rendered. Conveniently Mapnik 2.1 now supports rendering direct from CSV files and one of the supported `comp-op` modes is `darken`, so matching Shaun's exact output was pretty straightforward. You can find the full Mapnik XML below:
