title: "Windows binaries (Release Candidate 0)"
author: Artem Pavlenko

<p>Hello, Windows users! Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>
Following 2.0 release, we have been working hard to port more features, support more compilers and ultimately to make the whole process of building and using Mapnik on Windows more fun.
</p>
<p>
So, here are the <a href="https://github.com/downloads/mapnik/mapnik/mapnik-2.0.1rc0.zip">latest Windows 32-bit binaries (RC0) </a>. They are built with Visual C++ 2008 Express and require vc90 runtime. Python bindings support version 2.7.  
</p>
    
<h4>Cairo backend support</h4>

<p>This feature has been around for a while but it was missing from Windows binaries.
Now it's possible to generate PDF, PS and SVG on Windows, too.</p>

<h4>Microsoft SQL Server</h4> 
<p>
Currently through OGR plug-in it's possible to load spatial data from MSSQL.

<i>(Tested with Microsoft SQL Server 2012 RC0)</i>
</p>

<p>
Give it a try and give us feedback!
</p>
<p>
PS. There is more "Windows" news on the way, so stay tuned.
</p>
