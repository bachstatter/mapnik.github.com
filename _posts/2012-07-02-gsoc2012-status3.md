title: "Summer of Code 2012: Status update"
author: Hermann Kraus

Last week I finally merged the test code for my [Summer of Code project](http://mapnik.org/news/2012/05/29/gsoc2012) into Mapnik's code. 

The code currently doesn't render any output image but it already does this:

* Load correct font
* Process each part of the text with correct direction, script and format settings
* Print a list of all glyphs

I also added test cases from the [bug reports](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/assigned/herm?direction=desc&labels=unicode&sort=updated&state=open) and removed lots of code that is no longer needed.

Line breaking was not added yet, it turned out to be even more complex than I initially thought. 
First I want to get my code to actually render output because this makes verifying correct operation of the line breaking algorithm much easier.

## Next steps

As written above I will work on rendering next. This is a big task and I don't expect to get more than rendering done this week.
